Ansible is a free software platform for configuring and managing computers.
It combines multi-node software deployment, ad hoc task execution, and configuration management.
It manages nodes over SSH or PowerShell and requires Python (2.4 or later) to be installed on them.
Modules work over JSON and standard output and can be written in any programming language.
The system uses YAML to express reusable descriptions of systems.

The platform was created by Michael DeHaan, the author of the provisioning server application 
Cobbler and co-author of the Func framework for remote administration.
It is included as part of the Fedora distribution of Linux, owned by Red Hat inc., 
and is also available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Scientific Linux 
via Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) as well as other operating systems.
Ansible is commercially supported and sponsored by Ansible, Inc.
