ANSIBLE on UBUNTU:
------------------

Step 1 : Install
	Here we'll use the ppa:ansible/ansible repository as it is easy to remember.
	# apt-get-repository -y ppa:ansible/ansible
	# apt-get update
	# apt-get install -y ansible
	
Step 2 : Managing Servers
	Ansible has a default inventory file used to define which servers it will be managing. 
	After installation, there's an example one you can reference at /etc/ansible/hosts.
	I usually copy and move the default one so I can reference it later:
	# mv /etc/ansible/hosts /etc/ansible/hosts.orig
	
	Then I create my own inventory file from scratch. 
	After moving the example inventory file, create a new /etc/ansible/hosts file, and define some servers to manage. 
	Here's we'll define two servers under the "web" label:
	[web]
	192.168.1.50
	192.168.1.51
	
	For testing this article, I created a virtual machine, installed Ansible, and then ran Ansible Tasks directly on that server. 
	To do this, my hosts inventory file simply looked like this:
	[local]
	127.0.0.1
